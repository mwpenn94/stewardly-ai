# PARITY.md — Build Loop Synchronization Doc

This doc is the two-way sync point between the self-directed build loop
(the agent producing shipped code pass by pass) and any parallel processes
(assessment agents, review agents, or future-you). It is intentionally
simple: a gap matrix, a protected-improvements list, a known-bad list, a
reconciliation log, and a build-loop pass log.

## Scope

**Feature area:** Dynamic CRUD for any integration, pipeline, or ingestion
process, including cases where integration docs/support are limited or
nonexistent but sample data is available from sources. Force multipliers
across code chat, AI chat financial capabilities, learning/training/
onboarding, CRM/marketing, workflow automation, agentic AI/browser/device
automation, and continuous model training.

## Protected Improvements

These are anti-regression invariants. No pass should weaken or undo these
without explicit user instruction. Every protected improvement cites the
commit that first shipped it.

- **P1 → schema inference engine** (server/services/dynamicIntegrations/
  schemaInference.ts) — pure-function schema inference with 30 unit tests.
  Must stay pure (no I/O), must keep `inferSchema`, `suggestCrudMapping`,
  `mergeSchemas`, `summarizeSchema`, and `normalizeFieldName` as exported
  surfaces. Must keep primary-key detection only for bare `id`/`uuid`/`guid`
  (never `foo_id`). Must keep mixed-type fields classified as `mixed`.

- **P2 → adapter generator** (server/services/dynamicIntegrations/
  adapterGenerator.ts) — pure-function adapter DSL generator with 32 unit
  tests. Must stay pure (no I/O, no network). Must keep `generateAdapter`,
  `probeAuth`, `probePagination`, `detectCollectionPath`, `buildCurlExamples`,
  `summarizeAdapter` as exported surfaces. Must keep the ReadinessReport
  semantics: `baseUrl` and `auth.type` are both required for `ready=true`.
  Must keep get/update/delete endpoints conditional on primary-key presence.

- **P3 → adapter runtime** (server/services/dynamicIntegrations/
  adapterRuntime.ts) — executes an AdapterSpec against live HTTP with 37
  unit tests (mock fetchImpl injected). Must keep `listRecords`, `getRecord`,
  `createRecord`, `updateRecord`, `deleteRecord`, `upsertRecord` as exported
  surfaces. Must NOT depend on global fetch singleton — every call must
  accept a fetchImpl so tests stay offline. Must keep 429/5xx retry honoring
  Retry-After header. Must keep upsertRecord 404-fallback-to-create semantics.
