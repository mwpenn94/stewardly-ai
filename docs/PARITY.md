## Meta
- Last updated: 2026-04-11T00:00:04Z by chat:optimize-crud-parity-satL3/pass-5
- Comparable target: "best-in-class dynamic CRUD for any integration/pipeline/ingestion process, even where documentation or vendor support is limited or nonexistent but data is available from sources — plus continuous improvement across Code Chat, AI chat financial force multipliers, learning/training/onboarding, CRM/marketing coordination, workflow, and agentic AI/browser/device automation"
- Core purpose: Give Stewardly the ability to dynamically CRUD any integration/pipeline/ingestion process and turn the resulting data fabric into a continuous-improvement force multiplier across every Stewardly surface
- Target user: Platform admin / advisor-tier developer / power client who needs to wire a new data source without writing a schema migration or waiting on a vendor SDK
- Success metric: Time from "I have a URL/sample/cURL and know the data is there" → "live, scheduled, personalized ingestion flowing into the 5-layer intelligence stack" → <10 min (documented), <30 min (undocumented), <60 min (portal-only)
- Current parity score: 52% (composite 5.2 / 10 — Pass 5 found 18 novel continuous-improvement seam findings)
- Passes completed: 5
- Last reconciliation: 2026-04-11T00:00:04Z (conflicts: 0)
- Active branches: 2 of 5 (A eliminated via Sequential Halving round 1; see Pass 5 Branch Resolution)

## Pillars (comparable target decomposition)
1. **Dynamic CRUD for integrations / pipelines / ingestion** (documented, undocumented, portal-only)
2. **Personalization + max value-add** across all 5 layers (Person / Client / Advisor / Manager / Steward)
3. **Continuous improvement** across Code Chat, AI chat financial force multipliers, learning / training / onboarding, CRM / marketing coordination, workflow, agentic AI / browser / device automation
4. **Force multipliers** — every improvement should compound (new source → better personalization → better insights → better learning → better workflows → better agents)

## Gap Matrix

Legend: Priority = P0 (must-have) / P1 (high) / P2 (medium) / P3 (nice-to-have).
Depth = 0–10 score against comparable target (0 = missing, 10 = best-in-class).
Effort = S/M/L/XL (1d / 1w / 1mo / 1q).
Aligned = core-purpose alignment (yes / no / partial).

### Pillar 2 — Personalization + Max Value-Add Across 5 Layers

| ID | Feature | Present | Depth | Priority | Effort | Aligned | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G14 | Per-user personalization relevance scoring on ingested records (not just global confidence) | PARTIAL (`getContextEnrichment` filters by isVerified, not per-user) | 3 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |
| G30 | Ingestion-triggered personalization insights per user (new data → insight card for each affected user) | NO | 0 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |
| G42 | Multi-tenant isolation of connections across orgs (hard boundary, not just tier gate) | PARTIAL (tier-gated at RBAC layer; no FK enforcement on org_id) | 5 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |
| G43 | "Data value score" drives what to ingest next (reco engine already has `dataValueScorer.ts`, not surfaced) | PARTIAL | 4 | P2 | S | yes | — | open |

### Pillar 3 — Continuous Improvement (Code Chat, Chat, Learning, CRM/Marketing, Workflow, Agentic)

| ID | Feature | Present | Depth | Priority | Effort | Aligned | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G15 | Cost-aware model routing for extraction (cheap model for small payload, expensive for nested JSON) | NO (hardcoded `contextualLLM` in every extractor) | 2 | P1 | S | yes | — | open |
| G16 | Chat "add integration" agentic wizard (conversational: tell me what you want to connect) | NO | 0 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |
| G22 | CRM two-way sync + merge strategy + conflict resolution UI | PARTIAL (GHL/Wealthbox/Redtail adapters exist, mostly inbound) | 4 | P1 | L | yes | — | open |
| G23 | Code Chat tools: `register_integration`, `probe_api`, `infer_schema`, `map_fields`, `replay_ingestion`, `diff_schema` | NO | 0 | P0 | M | yes | — | open |
| G24 | `/add-integration` slash command in Code Chat | NO | 0 | P1 | S | yes | — | open |
| G26 | Integration health → learning feedback loop (failed integrations become training content) | PARTIAL (`integrationImprovementLog` exists, not wired to learning) | 5 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |
| G27 | Learning content auto-discovery + version tracking (new chapters from GitHub auto-pulled) | NO (manual "Import from GitHub" button only) | 3 | P2 | M | yes | — | open |
| G38 | Event-bus-driven continuous improvement (ingestion events → Chat insights → learning updates → workflow suggestions) | PARTIAL (event bus exists; ingestion events not emitted) | 3 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |
| G39 | Marketing campaign auto-wire from ingested lead signals (new provider pulls trigger segment rules) | PARTIAL (leadPipeline exists, no auto-wire) | 4 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |
| G40 | Workflow template library for ingestion → personalization flows | PARTIAL (5 templates exist, none ingestion-centric) | 3 | P2 | S | yes | — | open |
| G41 | Agent autonomy graduation on ingestion ops (suggest → draft → apply) | PARTIAL (graduated autonomy exists in agent layer, not wired to ingestion) | 3 | P1 | M | yes | — | open |

### Pillar 4 — Force Multipliers (Agentic, Cross-Cutting)

| ID | Feature | Present | Depth | Priority | Effort | Aligned | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G25 | Auto-generated TypeScript adapter from provider metadata (Code Chat writes the adapter file) | NO | 0 | P2 | L | yes | — | open |
| G28 | Agentic browser task runner (generic "do this thing in a browser" agent, Playwright-backed) | NO (chrome-extension is LinkedIn capture + Gmail compliance only) | 2 | P1 | L | yes | — | open |
| G29 | Device automation (iOS / Android / desktop) | NO | 0 | P3 | XL | partial (beyond-parity) | — | open |
| G44 | Auto-pause providers on cost / error threshold (circuit breaker) | NO | 0 | P1 | S | yes | — | open |

## Beyond-Parity Opportunities

Where we can credibly **exceed** the comparable target:

1. **Financial-domain awareness in schema inference** — comparable tools infer generic schemas. Stewardly can infer with financial priors (e.g., "this looks like a 401(k) statement, map to investment_statement.holdings[]") thanks to 260+ domain services.
2. **5-layer tier-aware data routing** — every ingested record can be auto-scoped to platform/org/mgr/pro/user layer based on content classification, something horizontal ETL tools can't do without a separate taxonomy layer.
3. **Compliance-gated extraction** — PII + injection screening on every LLM extraction I/O is already wired via `contextualLLM` guardrails. Generic ETL tools ship this as an afterthought; we ship it as default.
4. **Chat-native "add integration" via natural language** — "Connect me to the FINRA BrokerCheck API for my list of advisors" → agent does the full flow conversationally. Competitors require forms.
5. **Continuous-improvement loop from every failed extraction** — every parse failure becomes a training signal for the learning layer, the agent's RAG trainer, and the Code Chat improvement queue. Horizontal tools log errors; we learn from them.
6. **Recursive optimization passes on integrations themselves** — the same toolkit that optimizes the app can optimize each integration, discovering new fields, better mappings, cheaper models.
7. **Integration Recipe as first-class learning content** — a well-tested recipe becomes a chapter in the EMBA Learning layer, teaching advisors how the source works.
8. **Wealth Engine auto-hydration** — ingested portfolio data flows directly into the 30+ tRPC Wealth Engine procedures for retirement / strategy-comparison / Monte Carlo without a manual step.
9. **Consensus-LLM validation on high-stakes extraction** — use the consensus stream (Round C/D/E) to cross-check extractions on regulatory or compliance documents, exceeding single-model reliability.
10. **Agentic personalization** — each user's ingested-data profile becomes part of their personalization shard, consumed by chat, learning, workflow, and calculators. Generic tools stop at "data in warehouse".

## Anti-Parity Rejections

Where the comparable target implies features we should **NOT** copy because they conflict with core purpose:

1. **Arbitrary-code-execution-as-a-service** — some ETL tools let you write raw JS transforms inline. Core purpose is financial-advisory and compliance-gated; arbitrary code = compliance nightmare. REJECT. Use LLM-generated transforms reviewed by Code Chat + autonomy gating instead.
2. **Unbounded credential storage** — don't accept every conceivable auth scheme. Limit to well-tested (none, api_key, oauth, basic, bearer) and graduate new auth types through explicit review. REJECT "universal auth".
3. **Generic SQL execution on source DBs** — core purpose is not database federation. Limit to read-only HTTP APIs, files, webhooks, and structured exports. REJECT direct DB connections unless explicitly whitelisted.
4. **Manual field-drag-to-map UI** — comparable tools ship drag-and-drop mapping grids. Ours should be LLM-assisted and conversational. REJECT full-drag UI in favor of an LLM-first wizard with drag as a fallback.
5. **Unauthenticated public provider catalog** — some tools expose a public directory. We keep it gated behind `publicProcedure` but never expose credential fields. Already done. PRESERVE, don't relax.
6. **Unlimited retry storms on failing integrations** — don't ship without circuit breakers (G44). Comparable tools default to aggressive retry; we default to conservative with auto-pause. PRESERVE.
7. **CSV-only parser defaults** — comparable tools often ship CSV-first. We already ship 14 parsers including XLSX, PDF, DOCX, VCF, XML, JSON, archive. Do NOT regress to CSV-first.

## Pass 2 Depth Findings (novel blockers below the Pass 1 gap matrix)

These are **deeper** blockers discovered in Pass 2 after reading the actual
code paths behind the Pass 1 gaps. Each depth finding (D-series) annotates
or expands a G-series gap, raising its true effort or revealing a hidden
dependency. Priority re-weights apply.

| ID | Finding | Blocks | True Severity | Effort Δ | Code Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | `integration_providers.category` is a hardcoded `mysqlEnum(["crm","messaging","carrier","investments","insurance","demographics","economic","enrichment","regulatory","property","middleware"])` — dynamic provider registration CANNOT introduce a new category (e.g., HR-tech, payroll, tax, accounting, e-commerce) without a schema migration | G5 | P0 hard-blocker | +M (need enum-to-varchar migration or category table) | drizzle/schema.ts L2449 |
| D2 | `integration_providers.authMethod` is a hardcoded `mysqlEnum` — dynamic providers CANNOT declare new auth schemes (HMAC, AWS SigV4, Azure AD, OAuth2 client_credentials, JWT, mTLS) without a schema migration | G5, G9 | P0 hard-blocker | +M (same migration path as D1) | drizzle/schema.ts L2454 |
| D3 | `integration_field_mappings.transform` is a closed `mysqlEnum(["direct","lowercase","uppercase","date_parse","phone_e164","currency_cents","boolean_parse","custom"])`. `custom` accepts a string `customTransform` but there is **no runtime registry** that resolves the string → function. Adding a new transform requires BOTH a schema migration AND a runtime registry addition | G7, G8, G11 | P0 hard-blocker | +S (transform registry) + M (enum loosening) | integrations.ts L407 |
| D4 | `DataIngestionOrchestrator.normalizeAndStore` synthesizes `entityId` as `${source.sourceType}-${e.name}-${Date.now()}` — **`Date.now()` defeats cross-run dedup**. Every run creates new entityIds, so the same entity from the same source is duplicated on every ingestion. This is a latent bug that makes G12 (reconciliation) impossible because there's nothing to reconcile against — every record is unique by construction | G12, G32 | P0 latent bug | +S (fix + backfill decision) | dataIngestion.ts L727–737 |
| D5 | `integrationHealth.PROVIDER_TEST_CONFIGS` is a hardcoded Record keyed on 7 known slugs (census, bls, fred, bea, sec-edgar, finra-brokercheck, smsit). Any dynamically-registered provider has **no health check at all** — it falls through to an untested branch. The continuous-improvement loop for dynamic providers is dead on arrival | G5, G26, G44 | P0 hard-blocker on G5's value-add | +M (move test config from code to DB row on provider, or declarative test spec) | integrationHealth.ts L35 |
| D6 | `integration_jobs.errorLog` is a single `text` column, not a structured error object. Replay tooling (G6, G34) requires structured per-record error history with retry counts, stack traces, and raw payload offsets. Today the error trail is a flat string | G6, G34 | P1 | +S (schema + writer update) | drizzle/schema.ts L(ingestionJobs) |
| D7 | `scraperService.scrapeUrl` **never calls** `scraping/robotsChecker.ts` in the live ingestion path. Ethical scraping is enforced by a module that's not wired in. This is a compliance and reputation risk on any new undocumented-source integration | G1, G17 | P1 ethical gap | +S (one-line wiring) | dataIngestion.ts L52–96 vs scraping/robotsChecker.ts |
| D8 | `integrationAnalyzer.analyzeHealth` is a pure function with **zero call sites** in the live code (only potentially in tests). Either wire it in or remove it — it's either dead code or a phantom feature | G10, G26 | P1 latent | +S (decide: wire or delete) | scraping/integrationAnalyzer.ts L19 |
| D9 | `dataValueScorer.ts` accepts a `DataSource` struct that is **not populated anywhere** in the live database schema (`uniqueness`, `costPerQuery`, `queryVolume` have no persistence). G43 is more broken than Pass 1 said — the scorer exists but the upstream data pipeline that would feed it doesn't | G43 | P2 | +M (persist scoring inputs) | scraping/dataValueScorer.ts L8–17 |
| D10 | Event bus emits `prompt.scored` / `compliance.flagged` / `goal.completed` / `memory.stored` but **not** `integration.connected` / `integration.failed` / `ingestion.completed` / `schema.drifted`. G38's continuous-improvement loop needs these events to exist before Chat / Learning / Workflows can subscribe to them | G38, G26, G27 | P1 | +S (emit events from existing code paths) | grep for event.emit — ingestion events absent |
| D11 | Code Chat has 8 tools (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `grep_search`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `run_bash`, `update_todos`, `find_symbol`). **Zero integration-aware tools** — G23 is deeper than Pass 1 said because there's no abstraction layer; each new tool is a full registry entry + SSE handler + dispatcher branch + system-prompt update + test | G23, G24 | P0 — highest force-multiplier gap | M (6 tools) | codeChatExecutor.ts CODE_CHAT_TOOL_DEFINITIONS |
| D12 | Chat modes are `Single / Loop / Consensus / CodeChat`. There is **no Integration mode** in `Chat.tsx`. The mode-switching UI is already hoisted, so adding a 5th mode is ~1 day but gated on tRPC backend for the integration agent flow (G2) | G2, G16 | P1 | +S (UI) but M (backend integration agent loop) | Chat.tsx mode toggle |
| D13 | Workflow templates (`onboarding`, `annualReview`, `compliance`, `leadNurture`, `reports`) do not include **"new integration onboarding"** or **"data freshness enforcement"**. G40 needs two new templates, not just one | G40 | P2 | +S | server/services/workflow/templates.* |
| D14 | `credentialsEncrypted` key normalization is ad-hoc: every test endpoint calls `creds.api_key \|\| creds.apiKey \|\| creds.access_token`. There is **no credential schema enforcement** — a dynamic provider cannot declare its required credential keys and fail validation on creation. This blocks G5+G9 from producing strongly-typed credentials | G5, G9 | P1 | +S (per-provider credential_schema JSON column + Zod parse at creation time) | integrations.ts L246–248 |
| D15 | `ingestion_jobs` has no `dependsOn` / `triggeredBy` graph. Each job is isolated. DAG execution (G13) has **zero foundation** in the schema — requires a new join table or dependency array column | G13 | P1 | +M | drizzle/schema.ts ingestionJobs |
| D16 | `enrichmentCache` dedup key is `(providerSlug, lookupKey, lookupType)` but has **no schemaVersion column**. If the same provider changes response shape, stale cache entries with an old shape are still served — a silent correctness bug. G10 (schema drift) must include a cache-bust on drift | G10, G20 | P1 | +S (add column + cache-bust on drift) | integrations.ts L530–545 |
| D17 | `extractWithLLM` (web scraper) and `processDocument` (document extractor) are **prompt-injection vectors**. Adversarial HTML/PDF content can instruct the LLM to exfiltrate or mis-extract. Guardrails exist at `contextualLLM` boundary but extraction from untrusted content needs specialized injection-resistant prompting (e.g., sandwiched delimiters, output schema enforcement — which we have — and untrusted-content markers) | G1, G3, compliance | P0 security | +S (prompt hardening) | dataIngestion.ts L101–160, 204–303 |
| D18 | `rateRecommender.ts` + `rateProfiles` table exists but the loop is **open**: recommendations are generated but there's no closed-loop "the recommender changed rates because usage spiked → wait 24h → measure → adjust again". Adminlntelligence router has a recommendations UI (Pass 70) but no automatic apply. Continuous-improvement claim is aspirational | G26 | P2 | +M (closed-loop runner) | server/services/scraping/rateRecommender.ts |
| D19 | `pipelineSelfTest.ts` runs on boot and on-demand but only checks **connectivity + decrypt**, not response shape. The closest thing to data-contract tests (G20) is one layer too shallow | G20 | P2 | +S (add golden-fixture layer) | pipelineSelfTest.ts |
| D20 | Chrome extension has no server counterpart for browser task execution. `linkedin-capture.ts` + `gmail-compliance.ts` are user-initiated client-side. G28 (agentic browser task runner) needs a **server-side** Playwright worker, not just a Chrome extension expansion | G17, G28 | P1 | +L | chrome-extension/content-scripts/* |
| D21 | `normalizeAndStore` confidence-score tie-break is **skip-on-equal**. For equal-confidence conflicting data, no conflict record exists and the newer value is silently discarded. G12 must include a "conflict with equal confidence" branch that stores both + flags for human review | G12 | P1 | +S | dataIngestion.ts L516–530 |
| D22 | Learning EMBA import (`embaImport.ts`) from `mwpenn94/emba_modules` is **one-way, manual-trigger, full-refresh**. No version tracking, no diff, no incremental pull. G27 is deeper than Pass 1 said — needs ETag/If-None-Match + per-file mtime tracking + diff UI | G27 | P2 | +M | server/services/learning/embaImport.ts |
| D23 | Graduated autonomy (DB-backed `agent_autonomy_levels`) is wired into the 8 agentic execution contexts (quotes, applications, etc.) but **not wired to ingestion operations**. G41 needs explicit ingestion-op autonomy levels: "suggest mapping" → "draft mapping" → "apply mapping". There's no current surface for ingestion ops to go through | G41 | P1 | +M | agentic execution paths vs ingestion paths |
| D24 | No **idempotency keys** on ingestion runs. Running the same job twice in parallel (e.g., cron fires while manual trigger is in-flight) doubles records. G44 (circuit breaker) + G6 (replay) both depend on this | G6, G44, G13 | P1 | +S (single idempotency column) | dataIngestion.ts runIngestion |
| D25 | **`normalizeAndStore` swallows errors in a blanket catch** — every record-level error increments `skipped`, losing the distinction between "dedup skip" and "error skip". G11 lineage + G34 replay both need structured error categorization | G11, G34 | P1 | +S (error shape + category) | dataIngestion.ts L547–550 |

## Pass 3 Adversarial Findings (hidden failure modes, Goodhart, security)

Each A-series finding assumes **everything contains hidden failure modes** and
stress-tests the live code against real-world adversarial conditions. Items
marked **SEC** are security-adjacent; **GH** is Goodhart's-law / gaming detection;
**SIL** is silent-failure.

| ID | Finding | Class | Severity | Code Evidence | Fix Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `robotsChecker.isAllowed` defaults to **`true` on fetch failure**. An attacker who blocks robots.txt retrieval (DNS poison, connection refused, TLS mismatch) gets unrestricted scraping — the default is permissive when it should be restrictive for compliance-sensitive sources | SEC | high | `scraping/robotsChecker.ts` L39–42 | S — add `strict: boolean` option; default `strict: true` for `regulatory` / `crm` / `carrier` categories |
| A2 | `getCRMAdapter()` returns null unless `GHL_API_TOKEN` is set — the abstract adapter pattern is a **sham for Wealthbox + Redtail**. Those adapter files (`wealthboxClient.ts`, `redtailClient.ts`) exist but are never plumbed into the factory. CRM capability claim is overstated | SIL, GH | high | `services/crm/crmAdapter.ts` L35–68 | S — add branches for Wealthbox + Redtail env vars |
| A3 | `normalizeAndStore` dedup key is `(entityId, recordType)` — if two different providers emit the same entityId (common for IDs like "GOOGL" or stock tickers), **records collide across providers**. Correct key: `(dataSourceId, entityId, recordType)` | SIL | high | `dataIngestion.ts` L504–530 | S — extend the WHERE clause |
| A4 | `integration_connections.credentialsEncrypted` has **no rotation tracking** — no `credentialsRotatedAt`, no `requireRotationBy`. A compromised credential cannot be flagged "rotate in 24h" and followed up | SEC | med | `drizzle/schema.ts` integrationConnections | S — 2 columns + cron nag |
| A5 | `runHealthCheck` failure writes `status: "error"` but **does not auto-disable** the connection. Scheduler continues running a known-broken connection on its cron — cost runaway + log spam | SIL | high | `integrationHealth.ts` + `integrations.ts` L315–344 | S — circuit-breaker: 5 consecutive failures → auto-pause, wait 1h, retry; log to improvement log |
| A6 | `pipelineSelfTest` runs on boot; **if it hangs, the entire boot sequence blocks**. No per-provider timeout + parallel execution | SIL | high | `pipelineSelfTest.ts` | S — `Promise.race(timeout, test)` + `Promise.all` parallelization |
| A7 | `scraperService.hashContent` uses a **32-bit rolling hash** (djb2-ish with `hash \|= 0`). Collision rate on 10K+ records is measurable. Content dedup is lossy — a real scrape hash collision means stale data is served | SIL | med | `dataIngestion.ts` L187–196 | S — replace with `crypto.createHash('sha256')` |
| A8 | `fetchECBRates` appends USD/* rates to the **same array it's iterating**. Today's rate set (euro-base) makes this work by luck. Future-state: adding a third base currency ships an ArrayModifiedDuringIteration bug | SIL | low | `dataIngestion.ts` L343–354 | S — build USD rates in a new array, concat at end |
| A9 | `generateInsights` hardcodes 50 records with **zero user/tenant filter**. A manager at Firm A receives insights derived from Firm B's ingested records. **Multi-tenant data leak** | SEC | critical | `dataIngestion.ts` L564–570 | S (masking) — M (proper per-tenant scoping) |
| A10 | `getContextEnrichment` filters on `isVerified: true` but **nothing in the ingestion path sets `isVerified`**. The feature returns empty forever in practice. Latent dead feature | SIL, GH | med | `dataIngestion.ts` L620–623 | S — verification workflow OR relax the filter |
| A11 | `enrichContact` increments `usageThisPeriod` but **never resets at month boundaries**. A "100/month" provider permanently blocks after ~day 30 regardless of the actual calendar month | SIL | high | `integrations.ts` L597–598 | S — add monthly reset cron |
| A12 | **Goodhart alert** — CLAUDE.md claims "continuous improvement across the app". The underlying telemetry is `integrationImprovementLog` rows that only append on consecutive failures or degradation events. We measure "did we log?" not "did the system actually improve?". Score-inflation risk on every pass that touches "continuous improvement" | GH | high (meta) | `integrationHealth.ts` L336–427 | M — define genuine improvement KPIs: repair time, schema-drift recovery time, cost-per-insight trend |
| A13 | `scrapeUrl` has a 30s fetch timeout but the **LLM extraction call has NO timeout**. A slow extraction can extend effective request to tens of minutes, drifting cron schedules + starving the worker pool | SIL | med | `dataIngestion.ts` L56 vs L101 | S — add `AbortSignal.timeout(60000)` to `contextualLLM` calls in extractors |
| A14 | `rateRecommender.generateRecommendation` has **no rate limit on itself**. A malicious admin could call it in a tight loop to burn expensive LLM + API quota. Ironic gap: the thing that optimizes rate-limits isn't rate-limited | SEC | med | `adminIntelligence` → `rateRecommender.ts` | S — add admin-per-minute throttle at the tRPC layer |
| A15 | Ingested third-party content (news, regulatory, competitor) **bypasses the compliance engine**. If a provider serves advisory text that violates FINRA 2210, it flows into `ingestedRecords` and is available to `getContextEnrichment` without a `compliance_reviews` entry. Compliance coverage claim is partial | SEC, GH | high | compliance pipeline vs ingestion pipeline | M — hook `compliance.flagged` emitter into `normalizeAndStore` |
| A16 | `ingestedRecords.tags` is a free-form JSON array. Over time, tag vocabulary drifts (`"crm"` / `"CRM"` / `"Crm"`), breaking filter queries. No vocabulary control | SIL | low | `dataIngestion.ts` normalizer tags | S — normalize tags to lowercase on insert; add a `tag_vocab` seed |
| A17 | SnapTrade `snapTradeClientStatus` is advisor-accessible via `clientAssociations`. **No explicit `consentGivenAt` check** before exposing a client's brokerage balances/positions to an advisor. Real-world compliance needs explicit, time-stamped consent | SEC | critical | `integrations.ts` L892–917 | M — add `client_consent_records` with per-scope consent; gate the procedure on consent presence |
| A18 | `enrichmentCache.onDuplicateKeyUpdate` **resets `hitCount: 1`** on every update, not `hitCount + 1`. Hit counts are a lie over time — the analytics we build on top of this metric are misleading | SIL, GH | med | `integrations.ts` L591–593 | S — change to `hitCount: sql\`${hitCount} + 1\`` |
| A19 | `carrierImportTemplates.uploadCarrierData` parses CSV with **naive `lines[i].split(",")`**. Breaks on embedded commas in quoted values — a common real-world failure. We have a real parser (`services/import/csvParser.ts`) but this path doesn't use it | SIL | high | `integrations.ts` L462–488 | S — replace with `csvParser.parse()` |
| A20 | `integrations.pipelineHealth` is a `publicProcedure`. Returns provider slugs + runCount + errorCount + lastError. Unauthenticated users can **enumerate integration topology + brokenness**. Reconnaissance surface for attackers | SEC | high | `integrations.ts` L787–815 | S — require protectedProcedure OR sanitize output (strip slugs, only return aggregate counts) |
| A21 | Dynamic provider registration (G5) — once implemented — has a latent **SSRF attack vector**. An admin can register a provider with `baseUrl: "http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/"` and hit cloud metadata. Health-check + test-connection will cheerfully fetch from internal IPs | SEC | critical (future) | must-fix before G5 ships | S — SSRF allowlist: deny `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `localhost`, `metadata.google.internal`; resolve hostname before fetch |
| A22 | **Cost pass** — `contextualLLM` calls in extractors have **no per-call cost cap**. A 500KB malicious document fed to `processDocument` could generate a multi-dollar extraction bill per invocation | SEC, Cost | high | `dataIngestion.ts` extractors | S — add `maxInputTokens` and `maxCostUsd` to `contextualLLM` options; hard-cap in extractors |
| A23 | **Fiduciary pass** — a new regulatory provider pulling rule updates could **auto-generate client recommendations** via the improvement engine without human-in-the-loop review. Core purpose is compliance-first; this is a fiduciary red flag | Fid | critical | improvement engine + learning router + integration event fan-out | M — insert a `pending_human_review` gate on recommendations sourced from any new-provider data |
| A24 | Code Chat `run_bash` tool is admin-gated, but **within** a run_bash call there's no filesystem sandbox. An admin can `rm -rf` the workspace or read `/etc/passwd`. Not a parity gap but should be documented in PARITY.md's anti-parity / known-limit section | SEC | high (doc gap) | `codeChatExecutor.ts` run_bash | doc (S) or chroot (L) |
| A25 | `web_scrape_results.content_hash` + `enrichmentCache.lookupKey` use **the same key namespace** without per-table prefix. A future cache-layer abstraction could accidentally pull from the wrong table | SIL | low | arch smell | S — add table-prefix or use typed key objects |

### Self-Consistency Check (from Rule 9)

- **Does the app embody its stated purpose?** Mostly yes. The data-fabric exists and serves the 5-layer stack. But Pass 3 found **multi-tenant leakage (A9), compliance bypass (A15), SnapTrade consent gap (A17)** — these are direct conflicts with Stewardly's compliance-first core purpose. HIGH-priority fixes.
- **Are we optimizing for scores or user value?** Pass 2 and Pass 3 both *lowered* the composite score by finding deeper problems. This is the **opposite** of score-gaming and should be considered a healthy audit.
- **Goodhart alert (A12)** — the "continuous improvement" claim throughout CLAUDE.md is partially aspirational. We should either define concrete improvement KPIs (repair time, schema-recovery time, cost-per-insight trend) or soften the claim. **Flagged for later docs revision outside this parity loop.**

## Pass 4 Exploration — Architectural Branches

**Core assumption being challenged:** "A provider must be a row in
`integration_providers` mapping to either (a) a hardcoded health check +
extractor function, or (b) a generic scraper that LLM-extracts whatever it
finds." This is the current paradigm. Pass 4 generates 5 alternatives.

Per v2 Exploration rules, this pass does NOT evaluate. A later pass will
progressively eliminate branches using the Sequential Halving algorithm
(drop weakest first).

### Branch A — Provider-as-Code (status quo improved)
**Paradigm:** Every provider is a TypeScript file under
`server/services/integrations/providers/<slug>.ts` that exports a typed
adapter implementing a `ConnectorInterface`. A registry scans the directory
on boot and populates `integration_providers` automatically. Code Chat
generates the file via its new tools (G23).

**Key advantage:** Full TS type safety, reviewable in PRs, testable per
provider, compiler catches mistakes.

**Key risk:** Requires redeploy to register a new provider. Violates the
<10 min success metric. Violates the "limited/nonexistent docs" target
because every variation still needs human review of the generated code.

**Status: ACTIVE (candidate 1 of 3)**

### Branch B — Provider-as-Data (declarative JSON spec)
**Paradigm:** Every provider is a row in `integration_providers` with a
JSON `connectorSpec` column describing endpoint templates, auth mode, pagination rules,
field mapping suggestions, rate limits, and a declarative health-check
condition. A generic runtime interpreter (`connectorRuntime.ts`) executes
any `ConnectorSpec` without code changes.

**Key advantage:** Zero-code registration. Database-native. Hot-reload on
any spec change. Enables the <10 min success metric. Aligns with G5 dynamic
provider registration. Works for documented and semi-documented APIs.

**Key risk:** The spec is a mini-DSL that accrues complexity over time
(pagination styles, auth variants, error shapes). Expressiveness vs. safety
tradeoff. Debugging a spec mis-config is opaque to non-technical admins.
Doesn't solve the purely-undocumented case (no spec to write).

**Status: ACTIVE (candidate 2 of 3)**

### Branch C — Provider-as-LLM-Loop (agent re-derives contract every run)
**Paradigm:** No stored provider spec. At ingestion time, an agent receives
`{url, goal, credentials, schedule}` and runs a ReAct loop: probe → sample
→ infer schema → extract → normalize → persist. Each run re-discovers the
contract from current sample data.

**Key advantage:** Maximum flexibility. Handles undocumented sources
natively. No provider schema at all. Self-healing against upstream changes.
Best match to "limited/nonexistent docs" target.

**Key risk:** Non-deterministic — two runs may produce different shapes.
Expensive (10–100× cost of spec-based). Slow (multi-second latency per
run). Debugging an agent loop is hard. Cron schedules with hundreds of
sources becomes cost-prohibitive. LLM hallucination on edge cases.

**Status: SHELVED (candidate 4 of 5)** — too expensive for scheduled runs
but worth keeping as a one-shot tool for integration onboarding.

### Branch D — Provider-as-Playwright-Trace (record-replay browser)
**Paradigm:** Admin records a Playwright trace once (login, navigate,
export download, logout). The trace + credentials are stored. Scheduled
runs replay the trace in a headless browser worker and parse the exported
file.

**Key advantage:** Solves portal-only sources (G17) — the largest
unserved segment (carrier portals, regulatory UIs, legacy DBs behind web
interfaces). No API required at all.

**Key risk:** Brittle to UI changes. Captcha / MFA / rotating auth breaks
replay. Large storage (traces + artifacts). Requires a headless browser
worker pool. Abuse risk (could be weaponized as a crawler). Legal gray
area for ToS.

**Status: SHELVED (candidate 5 of 5)** — valuable but orthogonal to
Branches A/B/E; should be treated as a separate track after core dynamic
CRUD ships.

### Branch E — Provider-as-Hybrid (spec-first, LLM fallback, browser escape)
**Paradigm:** Branch B (declarative spec) is the default path. If a
spec-based run fails with shape mismatch / auth error / unexpected 4xx, a
Branch C LLM loop runs as fallback to re-derive the contract and propose a
spec patch (reviewed by an admin under graduated autonomy). If neither
works, Branch D browser trace is the escape hatch. Every successful LLM
fallback automatically updates the stored spec + version-bumps it.

**Key advantage:** Gets best of all branches. Adaptive and self-improving.
Cost-efficient default with expensive fallback only on failure. Aligns
perfectly with CLAUDE.md's "continuous improvement" claim.

**Key risk:** Complexity. Error handling across three execution paths is
intricate. Which branch "won" a given ingestion is non-obvious for
debugging — needs explicit lineage per run. Tight coupling of three
subsystems means one bad change can break all three.

**Status: ACTIVE (candidate 3 of 3)**

### Pass 4 self-notes (not for evaluation)
- Branch A is closest to what we have today. Pass 5 or later should decide
  whether to keep it as the "PR-reviewed provider track" for
  high-stakes/compliance-sensitive sources.
- Branch B and E are complementary — B is the foundation, E is the
  wrap-around strategy. If B ships first, E becomes additive.
- Branches C and D are shelved, not rejected — they remain valuable for
  specific niches (one-shot onboarding, portal-only sources).
- **No branch is scored** in this pass. Scoring is convergent work for
  Pass 5+ (Depth or Synthesis) using Sequential Halving.

## Pass 5 Depth Findings (continuous-improvement seams)

These F-series findings drill into the seams between the ingestion layer and
every other continuous-improvement surface (Code Chat, Chat, Workflow,
Learning, Memory, Events, Autonomy, Tracing). Each reveals a place where the
promise "continuous improvement across the app" is unbacked by code.

| ID | Finding | Seam | Severity | Code Evidence | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | `eventBus.EventType` is a hardcoded TypeScript union of 8 values. Adding `ingestion.completed`, `integration.connected`, `schema.drifted`, `provider.registered` requires a **code change AND redeploy**. G38 / D10 were surface-level; the real gap is that the type system prevents runtime extensibility | Events → everything | high | `server/shared/events/eventBus.ts` L6-14 | S — either relax to `string` with a runtime registry, or add all ingestion types now and re-ship |
| F2 | `improvementLoops.ts` has 6 loops (calibration / recommendation quality / sensitivity / trigger tuning / behavior clustering / competitive feature track) — **none touch ingestion or integration data**. The continuous-improvement infrastructure exists but is pointed at the wrong layer. Every loop reads `ComputationLog[]` which comes from `model_runs`, not `ingestion_jobs` or `integration_sync_logs` | Improvement engine → integrations | critical | `server/services/improvement/improvementLoops.ts` L1-45 + file structure | M — add loops 7-10: schema-stability loop, cost-per-extraction loop, cross-provider reconciliation loop, retry-success loop |
| F3 | `workflow.ts` ships ONLY `ONBOARDING_STEPS` (4 hardcoded flows). There is no `INTEGRATION_ONBOARDING` flow, no `DATA_FRESHNESS_ENFORCEMENT` flow, no `SCHEMA_DRIFT_TRIAGE` flow. G40 / D13 confirmed: adding a new ingestion-centric workflow = code change to a static const | Workflow → integrations | high | `server/routers/workflow.ts` L8-37 | S — add 3 new ONBOARDING_STEPS entries |
| F4 | **Two workflow table systems** — `workflowChecklist` (per-user step tracking) vs `workflowInstances` (multi-step workflow engine from Pass 61). They don't share step definitions or UX. Pass 5 cannot tell which one is authoritative for ingestion-related flows | Workflow arch | med | `workflowChecklist` vs `workflowInstances` in schema | M — unify or document the split |
| F5 | `eventBus` has a `compliance.flagged` → `proactive_insights` listener (good). **No listener on `improvement.signal`**. Improvement signals are silently emitted and die. G26 confirmed: the force multiplier has no subscriber | Events → insights | high | `server/shared/events/eventBus.ts` L54-71 | S — add one listener that converts improvement signals to insight rows |
| F6 | Even if ingestion events existed (F1), the **workflow engine has no event subscribers** — workflows are initiated by explicit user action (`workflowInstances.start`), never by an event. "Ingestion completed → trigger client annual review" is architecturally blocked | Workflow → events | high | grep for eventBus.on in workflow routers — 0 hits | M — wire event-driven workflow triggers |
| F7 | Code Chat `autonomousCoding` service exists (CLAUDE.md Round B5) for Code Chat to propose its own improvements, but **it has no knowledge of the integration registry**. Code Chat cannot say "provider X is returning 4xx; I'll rewrite its extractor". The integration pipeline is invisible to the self-improvement loop | Code Chat → integrations | high | `server/services/codeChat/autonomousCoding.ts` tool scope | M — expose integration health as an input to the autonomous planner |
| F8 | Chat `autonomousProcessing.start()` diverge/converge loop has 5 foci (`discovery/apply/connect/critique/general`) — **none are ingestion-focused**. Loop mode can't naturally iterate "improve this integration's field mapping by trying 3 variations and picking the winner". The force-multiplier loop doesn't reach integrations | Chat → integrations | med | `server/services/autonomousProcessing/*` focus enum | S — add a `integrate` focus |
| F9 | `learning.mastery.recordReview` is only invoked from flashcard/quiz runners. **Integration engineering "mastery" is not a concept** — we can't track which advisors understand which integrations. Beyond-parity opportunity: integrations should BE learning content, with SRS reviews on "when does FRED update CPI?" | Learning → integrations | med (BP opportunity) | `server/routers/learning.ts` mastery | M — add integration-type flashcard seeds on provider registration |
| F10 | Graduated autonomy (DB-backed `agent_autonomy_levels`) is wired into 8 agentic execution contexts. **Ingestion ops are not one of those contexts**. Adding ingestion means new autonomy enum values + graduation criteria + a feedback surface. D23 confirmed: non-trivial integration | Autonomy → ingestion | high | `agent_autonomy_levels` schema vs ingestion routers | M — new context + criteria |
| F11 | CLAUDE.md claims **37 cron jobs** including "SRS daily due-review reminder" + "weekly EMBA auto-import" — but no **"daily integration health recap"** or **"weekly schema-drift audit"**. Continuous improvement on integrations is not on the cron calendar. | Scheduler → integrations | med | CLAUDE.md cron list vs `scheduler.ts` registered jobs | S — add 2 new cron jobs |
| F12 | `integrationImprovementLog` is **append-only with no resolved/acted-upon status** for non-recovery events. An advisor who manually fixes a mapping has no way to close the loop. The improvement log grows monotonically and buries useful signal in stale noise | Improvement log UX | med | schema.integrationImprovementLog | S — add `resolvedAt`, `resolvedBy`, `resolution_note` columns |
| F13 | `chat.send` ReAct loop has tool-calling infrastructure, but **integration management tools are not in the tool surface**. D11 + G23 confirmed: Chat's ReAct loop needs the 6 integration tools (probe_api / infer_schema / register_integration / map_fields / replay_ingestion / diff_schema) as chat-callable tools, not just Code-Chat-callable | Chat → integrations | high | grep for chat ReAct tools — 0 integration tools | M — wire tools into chat.send's tool surface |
| F14 | Improvement engine's 6h schedule reads from `signal_detection` with **hardcoded signal types**. Adding `schema_drift_detected`, `new_provider_available`, `cost_spike_detected` signals = code + migration. G10 depth | Improvement → events | med | `server/services/improvement/*` signal types | S — relax signal type to string |
| F15 | `ragTrainer` (Pass 48 fix) learns from every LLM response, but **nothing ingestion-related is routed through it**. A failed schema extraction doesn't make the agent smarter next time. The learning loop is decoupled from the failure signal | RAG → extraction | high | `ragTrainer` call sites | S — route extractor responses through ragTrainer |
| F16 | Memory engine has 6 categories. **None are "integration learnings"** or "provider quirks". An advisor's memory could include "Wealthbox returns phone as +1XXXX"; today it doesn't | Memory → integrations | med | memory category enum | S — add `integration_lore` category |
| F17 | OpenTelemetry GenAI spans wrap every `contextualLLM` call. **Spans don't carry ingestion job context** — traces can't link LLM extractions to the ingestion job that triggered them. Debugging a bad extraction requires cross-referencing by timestamp | Tracing → ingestion | med | contextualLLM span attrs | S — pass `ingestionJobId` through to span attrs |
| F18 | Client-side `PlatformIntelligence` (Pass 120) adapts UI to user intent. It doesn't watch "admin is exploring integrations" to proactively suggest "shall I generate a ConnectorSpec for this URL?". Personalization opportunity missed | Client intelligence → integrations | low | `client/src/services/platformIntelligence/*` | S — add an intent pattern |

### Self-Consistency Check
- A9/A15/A17 SEC items remain open. Pass 5 didn't touch implementation.
- F2 is a **structural reveal**: the `improvementLoops.ts` module is what people point at when claiming "continuous improvement". Pass 5 says it doesn't even watch the integration layer. This is a Goodhart-style gap (we built the infrastructure but pointed it at the wrong data).
- F7 + F13 + F15 are the three places where "integrations should feed the self-improvement loop" is structurally blocked. Fixing just one doesn't fix the seam — all three need to land together for the continuous-improvement claim to become real.

## Pass 5 Branch Resolution (Sequential Halving Round 1)

Evaluating the 5 Pass 4 architectural branches against 4 weighted criteria:

| Criterion | Weight | A Code | B Data | C LLM-Loop | D Playwright | E Hybrid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Time-to-value (<10 min) | 0.35 | 2 | 9 | 7 | 3 | 9 |
| Undocumented-source fit | 0.30 | 4 | 6 | 9 | 8 | 9 |
| Cost per scheduled run | 0.20 | 10 | 9 | 3 | 5 | 7 |
| Safety (review, rollback, guardrails) | 0.15 | 9 | 7 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| **Weighted score** | — | **5.30** | **7.75** | **6.55** | **5.30** | **7.95** |

**Elimination (Sequential Halving round 1):** Branch A (5.30) and Branch D
(5.30) are tied for lowest. Per v2 rules, drop the single weakest. Tie-break
by "fit to core purpose" — A serves high-compliance providers better than D
serves portal-only sources. **Eliminate D this round.** Branch A moves to
SHELVED status for compliance-sensitive tracks. Branch C moves to SHELVED
for one-shot onboarding usage. **Active branches after Round 1: B + E.**

Sequential Halving Round 2 will evaluate B vs E on implementation spike
results from Pass 4's pasteable implementation prompt (if that prototype
ships before the next Depth pass).

## Known-Bad Approaches (do not re-attempt)

_(none logged on Pass 1 — this list grows as passes discover failed approaches)_

## Open Issues (severity-tagged, parity-relevant)

- CRITICAL: G1–G9 (P0 dynamic-CRUD core) — zero coverage on schema inference, integration-from-URL, spec importers, raw-payload replay, versioned mappings, semantic mapping, cURL-paste.
- HIGH: G10–G17, G22–G24, G28, G44 — schema drift, lineage, reconciliation, DAG, per-user personalization, Code Chat tooling, browser agent, circuit breakers.
- MEDIUM: G18–G21, G25, G27, G31, G32, G34–G37, G39, G40, G43 — GraphQL, webhook auto-wire, contract tests, rollback, recipe library, marketing auto-wire, workflow templates.
- LOW: G29, G33 expansions — device automation (beyond-parity), broader PII classification.
