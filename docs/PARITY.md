# Stewardly PARITY — Build Loop Work Queue

**Purpose.** Bidirectional work ledger for the continuous build loop. Two
kinds of rows live here:

1. **External recommendations** fed in by parallel assessment processes
   or prior build-loop passes. The build loop reads these, prioritizes
   open ones, and marks them done with a commit SHA.
2. **Build-loop findings** — gaps the build loop's own assessment stage
   noticed. The assessment loop then decides whether to re-verify, and
   future passes can pick them up.

**Scope for this file.** Learning experience optimization against the
`mwpenn94/emba_modules` repo content — SRS flow, cross-track study,
quiz and flashcard runners, importer resilience, agent tool coverage,
accessibility, cost, observability.

## Protected improvements (do not weaken)

These landed in prior passes and must not be regressed. Referenced by
`hybrid: pass N — …` commit prefixes in git log.

| # | Improvement | Landed | Protects |
|---|---|---|---|
| P-1 | `embaImport.ts` handles OBJECT-keyed `disciplines` map + `key`/`correct`/`correct_index` aliases (pass 76) | pass 76 | Import from GitHub does not crash on real emba_modules JSON shape. |
| P-2 | `LearningFlashcardStudy` / `LearningQuizRunner` wire answers into `mastery.recordReview` with 0-5 ladder (pass 58) | pass 58 | Every review advances confidence; `masterySummary.dueNow` counter moves. |
| P-3 | `LearningTrackDetail` lazy-loads subsections via `content.listSubsections` | pass 58 | Large tracks render without N+1 subsection fetches. |
| P-4 | Seed is idempotent (dedup by slug) and distinguishes inserted vs skipped (pass 76) | pass 76 | Re-running Seed does not double-insert disciplines/tracks. |
| P-5 | `CelebrationEngine` heavy/medium wired into quiz + flashcard completion | pass 155 | 100% / 80%+ completions trigger the particle effect. |
| P-6 | Quiz/flashcard `CompletionCard` uses a11y-friendly message tiers (100%/80%/60%) | pass 58 | No exclamation-only messaging; always a substantive wrap-up sentence. |
| P-7 | Cross-track due-review deck — `getDueReviewDeck()` + `LearningDueReview.tsx` + `learning.mastery.dueReview` tRPC query | pass 1 (build loop) | Learners can run a single mixed session over everything SRS-due across every track. |
| P-8 | `assessTrackReadiness` resolves track→content→mastery (NOT prefix match) — readiness=mastered/totalItems | pass 2 (build loop) | Agent's `assess_readiness` and `check_exam_readiness` tools return correct numbers. |
| P-9 | `start_review_session` agent tool exposes `learning.mastery.dueReview` to ReAct loop | pass 2 (build loop) | Agent can answer "what's due today" with real data. |
| P-10 | Pure `deckBuilder.ts` (mulberry32 + Fisher-Yates + 3 modes) drives flashcard + quiz runners with pre-session config | pass 3 (build loop) | Shuffle is seeded + reproducible, session caps work, weakest-first mode prioritizes weak material. |
| P-11 | `embaImport` persists every run to `.stewardly/learning_import_history.json` via `recordImportRun()` — best-effort, never throws | pass 4 (build loop) | Admins can audit "when did we last pull" + per-run inserts/skips/errors without log scraping. |
| P-12 | `LearningTrackDetail` shows per-chapter mastery progress via pure `buildTrackProgress` rollup | pass 5 (build loop) | Learners see exactly how much of each chapter they've covered + mastered. |

## Gap matrix

Status: `open` · `in-progress` · `done`
Source: `assessment` (parallel audit process) · `build` (this loop's own
assessment step) · `external` (user or upstream process)

| ID | Title | Scope | Source | Status | Depth | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G-1 | No cross-track due-review deck — learners can see `dueNow` count but have no UI to actually review mixed SRS items across tracks | learning | build | done | 6 | pass 1 | Landed pass 1; see `LearningDueReview.tsx` + `server/services/learning/dueReview.ts` |
| G-2 | `assessTrackReadiness` looks for itemKey prefix `track:${slug}:` but flashcard/quiz runners store keys as `flashcard:${id}` / `question:${id}` — readiness always returns 0 tracked | learning | build | done | 6 | pass 2 | Resolver now loads track→flashcards+questions, builds expected-key set, and matches mastery rows. Pure `computeReadiness` with 10 new tests. Legacy prefix still accepted so prior data isn't dropped. Shape also gained `totalItems` + `coverage`. |
| G-3 | Flashcard / quiz runners iterate entire deck — no session-size control (e.g. "review 10 cards") + no shuffle | learning | build | done | 6 | pass 3 | New pure `client/src/pages/learning/lib/deckBuilder.ts` (mulberry32 PRNG, Fisher-Yates shuffle, 3 modes: sequential / shuffle / weakest-first) + 32 unit tests. Wired into both `LearningFlashcardStudy` and `LearningQuizRunner` with a pre-session configure card (size 10/20/50/All, mode picker, mastery-aware "Weakest" mode disabled until user has prior history). |
| G-4 | LearningHome "Start review →" links to `tracks[0].slug/study` (first track alphabetically) — not to actual due items | learning | build | done | 6 | pass 1 | Now links to `/learning/review` |
| G-5 | Due-items hydrator has no agent-tool exposure — ReAct agent cannot start or describe a review session for the current user | learning | build | done | 4 | pass 2 | `start_review_session` tool added to `LEARNING_AGENT_TOOLS`, routed to `learning.mastery.dueReview`. Wiring test updated to 12-tool minimum. |
| G-6 | `embaImport` does not capture last-import-run metadata — admins cannot see when content was last pulled or what changed | learning | build | done | 6 | pass 4 | New `server/services/learning/importHistory.ts` persists every run to `.stewardly/learning_import_history.json` (50-entry ring buffer, defensive parser, pure summarizer). 19 unit tests + tmpdir round-trip. New `learning.importHistory` admin tRPC query. New `ImportHistoryPanel` in Content Studio with last-run / last-success / per-run delta + error samples. No schema migration. |
| G-7 | Track detail shows flashcard / question counts but not **chapter completion %** — no sense of where the learner is in the material | learning | build | done | 6 | pass 5 | New pure `client/src/pages/learning/lib/trackProgress.ts` (chapter bucketing, mastered/inProgress/unseen classification, completion + attempted percentages, completionStatus tier function). 21 unit tests covering empty inputs, bucketing edge cases, classification rules, totals integrity, percent rounding, status tiers, format helpers. New `<TrackProgressCard>` in `LearningTrackDetail` with track-level progress bar + per-chapter rows + unchaptered fallback. |
